#“This is a line from RStudio”

#Chapter 6 Notes: 
#  * In chapter 6 I learned about the keyboard shortcuts to run code in an R script (Cmd + Enter)
#  * I also saw the tip to put all librarys at the top. This makes sense and is similar to how I write python
  
#Chapter 11 Notes:
#  * I learned about how to read in a file using readr (from tidyverse)
#  * I also learned how to use the skip command to have the CSV reader start a few rows in instead
  
#Chapter 28 Notes: 
#  * I learned how to use caption in labs to put a caption label on a graph. This would be good for sources
#  * I was surpised how many different options there are in GGPlot to allow you to create the perfect graph for what you need.
